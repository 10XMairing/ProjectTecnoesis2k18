    <string name="draft_ritz">Designing plays an essential role in innovation. The field of designing accounts for majority of private research and development spending and employs a significant percentage of engineers. In order for society to benefit from the latest advances in technology, skilled engineers and novel designing techniques will be required.

There is a thirst among every engineer for designing, a thirst which is motivated by seeing day to day things ranging from a small pin to huge working machine. This thirst which has resulted for the designing of basic component parts of a machine to the design of highly sophisticated engines. General design competitions have always had a constraint that bounds the imaginative skills of the enthusiasts to create something new or intuitive, so to tackle this ASME NIT Silchar Chapter came up with this competition. It is a competitive event where the design and imaginative skills of the participants will be put to test under the ticking of a clock. </string>
